"""
Education API routes.

Provides endpoints to list and create 'Education' entries.

Author: Simon Neidig <mail@simon-neidig.eu>

- GET /education/  -> List education entries for a requested language.
- POST /education/ -> Create a new education entry (requires superuser).

Notes:
- Language is resolved via the `get_language` dependency.
- Database access is provided via an AsyncSession from `get_async_session`.
- Authorization for creating entries is enforced via fastapi-users (superuser).
