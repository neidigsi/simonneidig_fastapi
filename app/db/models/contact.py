"""
Contact DB model for FastAPI

Author: Simon Neidig <mail@simonneidig.de>

This module defines the Contact SQLAlchemy model which represents contact inquiries
submitted via the website's contact form. Contact records store sender information,
message content, timestamps and the language association. These records are persisted
and can be queried by the API to display or process incoming inquiries.
