Description:
This module defines Pydantic models for representing experience data.

The `ExperienceBase` class provides the base structure for an experience record,
while the `Experience` class extends it with additional fields, including details
about the title, description, industry, and the associated company. These models
are used for data validation and serialization in the application.
