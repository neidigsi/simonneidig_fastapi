# Schemas

All schema definitions for this FastAPI implementation are located in the files within this folder. Schemas define the structure of the data that is sent and received by the API. They are essential for ensuring consistency and clarity in the communication between the client and the server. By defining schemas, developers can validate data, enforce rules, and provide clear documentation for API consumers.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of schemas is to define the structure of the API's response objects. They ensure that the data returned by the API adheres to a predefined format, making it easier for clients to consume the data. Additionally, schemas are designed to be language-independent, meaning that the database access layer populates the objects with data in the requested language. This allows the API to support internationalization and provide localized responses.

## File Structure

The schemas are organized in a structured manner to maintain clarity and scalability. Each schema file typically contains:

- A base model that defines the core attributes of the object.
- An extended model that builds upon the base model by adding additional fields or functionality.
- A separate file for each conceptual object, ensuring modularity and ease of maintenance.

This centralized organization ensures that all schema-related logic is easy to locate and manage. It allows for clear separation of concerns and makes it easier to manage and extend the schemas as the application evolves.
